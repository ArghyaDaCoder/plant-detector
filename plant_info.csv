Pepper__bell___Bacterial_spot,Pepper bell,Bacterial spot,"Bacterial disease from Xanthomonas spp.; small water‑soaked to brown spots on leaves, stems, and fruit, often with yellow halos, causing defoliation and scabby fruit under warm, humid conditions.","Use certified disease‑free or hot‑water/bleach‑treated seed; plant resistant varieties; rotate crops; avoid overhead watering and crowded spacing; remove debris; apply copper‑based bactericides every 7–10 days."
Pepper__bell___healthy,Pepper bell,Healthy,No disease. Plant is healthy.,"Maintain proper care, hygiene, and pest monitoring."
Potato___Early_blight,Potato,Early blight,"Fungal disease caused by Alternaria solani. It forms concentric dark spots on older leaves and thrives in warm, moist conditions.",Use fungicides like chlorothalonil or mancozeb. Practice crop rotation and remove plant debris.
Potato___Late_blight,Potato,Late blight,"Caused by Phytophthora infestans, it leads to large, irregular dark patches on leaves and stems, rapidly destroying plants in cool, wet weather.",Apply fungicides such as metalaxyl or copper-based sprays. Destroy infected plants and avoid overhead watering.
Potato___healthy,Potato,Healthy,No disease. Plant is healthy.,"Maintain proper care, hygiene, and pest monitoring."
Tomato_Bacterial_spot,Tomato,Bacterial spot,"Caused by Xanthomonas bacteria, appears as water-soaked spots on leaves and fruits. Can cause defoliation and fruit lesions.","Use copper-based bactericides, practice crop rotation and avoid overhead watering. Use disease-free seeds."
Tomato_Early_blight,Tomato,Early blight,"Fungal disease caused by Alternaria solani. It forms concentric dark spots on older leaves and thrives in warm, moist conditions.",Use fungicides like chlorothalonil or mancozeb. Practice crop rotation and remove plant debris.
Tomato_Late_blight,Tomato,Late blight,"Caused by Phytophthora infestans, it leads to large, irregular dark patches on leaves and stems, rapidly destroying plants in cool, wet weather.",Apply fungicides such as metalaxyl or copper-based sprays. Destroy infected plants and avoid overhead watering.
Tomato_Leaf_Mold,Tomato,Leaf Mold,"Fungal disease caused by Passalora fulva, presents as yellow spots on upper leaf surfaces and olive-green mold on undersides.",Improve air circulation and apply fungicides like chlorothalonil or mancozeb.
Tomato_Septoria_leaf_spot,Tomato,leaf spot,"Commonly due to fungal pathogens like Septoria, creating small dark spots with a pale center on leaves.","Use copper fungicides, avoid leaf wetness, and remove infected leaves."
Tomato_Spider_mites_Two_spotted_spider_mite,Tomato,spider mite,"Infestation by tiny mites causing stippling and yellowing of leaves, often with fine webbing, leading to defoliation.","Use insecticidal soap, neem oil, or miticides. Introduce predatory mites and increase humidity."
Tomato__Target_Spot,Tomato,Target Spot,"Fungal disease forming dark spots with concentric rings, caused by Corynespora cassiicola, mostly affecting tomatoes.",Apply fungicides like chlorothalonil or azoxystrobin and remove infected leaves.
Tomato__Tomato_YellowLeaf__Curl_Virus,Tomato,Curl Virus,"Viral infection (e.g. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus) spread by whiteflies, causing curled, yellow leaves and stunted growth.","Control whiteflies with insecticides, use resistant varieties and remove infected plants."
Tomato__Tomato_mosaic_virus,Tomato,mosaic virus,"Viral disease leading to mottled patterns on leaves, reduced growth and distorted fruit, spread by contact or insects.","No cure; remove infected plants, control insect vectors, and disinfect tools."
Tomato_healthy,Tomato,Healthy,No disease. Plant is healthy.,"Maintain proper care, hygiene, and pest monitoring."
